### Journal, Week 4

Coming up on the halfway point of lecture. We'll pause this week to work out some kinks. Take some time tonight to write down where you're getting stuck and what you feel like would be most useful to get past it, so I can structure this week based on your needs. Put this work in a branch called `journal-week-4` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your _WIP Issue_! 

### Codewars

Write solutions for the three problems listed. Once all the tests pass, copy into files in your TIY-Assignments repo.

### Granular App

Address the open issue in the granular app. Push your code from local to your github granular app repo, and open
a PR from there to the class granular app repo.

### Connect Four

Look over the code I wrote for today and pick out which pieces would be useful in a Connect Four game and which
would have to be rewritten. Write down what you think in a README.md file.
