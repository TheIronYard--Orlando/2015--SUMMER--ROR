# Session is in Class

Just a couple of components for tonight. The granular app has two open issues to address,
and there's a bit of reading to begin to understand OAuth (and OAuth2, which is pretty similar).

The granular app has instructions on what you need to do in the issues.

The reading is as follows:

* http://blog.varonis.com/introduction-to-oauth/
* http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/03/29/oauth-explained-and-what-it-is-good-for/
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4113934/how-is-oauth-2-different-from-oauth-1

Also, look at the following gems (just the READMEs, you don't have to delve into source code)

* https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth-ruby
* https://github.com/intridea/oauth2

Try to work out how the methods given in the gems tie in to the workflow described in the reading.
