## ToRoman, ToPigLatin, or ToNumber

As we discussed, take any one of those three and, working test-first, write tests and code to demonstrate that 
you can make Roman numeral representations of numbers up to 2015, pig Latin representations of words, or change
string representation of words into integers (like "three hundred eighty two".to_number => 382).

The reading you can do at your leisure.
