# Javascript, or maybe Yavascript

It might be a soft 'j'.

## Assignment:

```markdown
* [ ] read
  * [ ] JS on MDN
  * [ ] DOM on MDN
  * [ ] JS on Treehouse
* [ ] Code School
* [ ] Journal
* [ ] Codewars
```

For the reading, it's ok to skim. Just get a feel for how Javascript acts like Ruby and how it acts differently.

If you are comfortable with the how-to stuff like Treehouse and Code School, you'll be fine. The JavaScript Garden
is really only for those who have some JS experience, or who want a lot of it.

You know the drill for the journal.

For CodeWars, try http://www.codewars.com/kata/musical-pitch-classes/ruby
