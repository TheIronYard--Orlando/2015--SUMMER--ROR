### Journal, Week 5

You know the drill. Explain to yourself what you have learned.

### Codewars

Write solutions for the three problems listed. Pair up as follows:

* Leslie and Heidi
* Devan and Erik
* John and me

Each student should type out the solution to at least two codewar katas.

No one who is not a student will type out any solutions. 

So on the first kata, Leslie, Devan, and John type; on the second,
Heidi, Erik, and John; on the third, all of yinz.

Once all the tests pass, copy into files in your TIY-Assignments repo.

### Granular App

Address the open issue in the granular app. Push your code from local to your github granular app repo, and open
a PR from there to the class granular app repo.
