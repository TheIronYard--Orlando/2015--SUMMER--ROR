# 08 - Placeholder

Never actually wrote this down on GitHub....

Mainly reading for Monday night:

* [The Rails README](https://github.com/rails/rails) (the Welcome to Rails section)
* [Letters of note](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/a-railsy-web-refresher) (HTTP, REST, URLs, MVC)
* [Routing](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/routing)
* [A tour of Rails folders](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/2015--SUMMER--ROR/blob/master/Notes/Week3/rails_directory_structure.md)

Also, write a second journal entry in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo.
