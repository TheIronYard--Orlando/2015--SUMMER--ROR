### Journal, Week 3

We're _one third through lecture time_. (More, actually - we were 1/3 through as of the end of Thursday.) You know more than you did a week ago, and probably more than you realize. Take some time tonight to review your notes and write them down. Use whatever format helps you get the ideas out: bulleted lists, stream of consciousness, retelling a story. It's not a bad idea to return to this from time to time and polish it during the week. Put this work in a branch called `journal-week-3` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your _WIP Issue_! The potential topic list grows:

* Ruby topics you've mastered
* Ruby topics you're struggling with
* GitHub and its shiny buttons
* Personal retrospective
* Things about the class that have surprised you
* Rails - the good, the bad, the magic
  * routes
  * MVC
  * helper methods (form_for, link_to, _path, ...)

### About HTML

There's not time in lecture to talk about everything you should know. You don't need to know HTML exhaustively, but you should know about a handful of heavily used elements and their attributes. For tonight, tables.

I think I had already asked you to look at the [HTML introduction page on the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction), so don't be surprised if it's familiar. Read over that mainly to refamiliarize yourself with the language of elements, tags, and attributes. Then go on to the MDN page on [tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table). For the tables page, I'd suggest starting with the examples, looking at both the HTML tags and the output, then going back to the top of the page to read about table attributes and how to avoid them, and what not to do with tables.

Then write down what you've learned in the `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Specifically,

* make a branch called `html-tables` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo
* make a file called `about/html_tables.md` which discusses HTML tables, perhaps with a couple of examples. 
* in the html_demo folder of that repo, make a table. Use tbody, thead, tr, td, and th tags.

## Reading

http://codebytes.us/intro-to-tdd/ is a quick read, no code, explaining why Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a good idea.

http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/intro-to-tdd.html  is a really nice step-by-step tutorial introduction to the methods and methodology we're going to be using to write code with test driven development in Ruby. Read that whole page and do the tutorial.

http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835 is a decent introduction to the thinking behind TDD. Unfortunately, this tutorial is based on PHP code, so there are sections you should skip:
* from "I'm Sold" until the end of "Step 1"
* any PHP code 

## Video

https://www.udemy.com/learn-test-driven-development-in-ruby/?couponCode=railsfree

I recommend going into your profile and changing preferences to use HTML5 video instead of flash, because that will allow you to change the speed of the videos. I found it best at 1.5x, because the instructor speaks very slowly but in a strong Indian accent, so normal speed feels very slow, but 2x is unintelligible.

You don't have to watch the whole video for tomorrow, but plan to finish by Thursday.
