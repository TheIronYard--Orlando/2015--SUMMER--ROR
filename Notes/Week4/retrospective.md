# Processes - Review of Last Week

## standup 
* we did a good job tightening this up
* probably accept that it'll be longer on Mondays
* maybe bring in a timer
* each person talks once, no cross-talk/comments (this worked)
* keep it at 9:00am

## quiz
* keep these
* mixture of technical details and big picture - Method of the Day
* translate code into English - using proper terminology
* adding some new material is good - MotD
* 15-ish minutes to take it about the right scale
* 30 min review? 
  * some answers presented without comment, some discussed in depth

## lecture
* agenda doesn't get timeboxed that well (still a problem)
  * set hard limit on HW review, so that new stuff can be covered in depth
  * balance needs of people who are getting value from HW review and people who want to go faster
  * relatively brief HW review during lecture; a mandatory and a beast mode, ~15 min each
  * add time outside of lecture hours for HW review (1pm)
* timer again would be helpful (class please Pomodoro me)
* balance between typing/listening/following along
  * _slack some files instead of making people type everything_!!!
  * slack (or possibly store on GitHub) for each day's stuff, so class can follow along, take notes
  * re-build during lecture, without need for students to type frantically to keep up
  * be more careful about how many tabs/windows are open
* more whiteboards for visualization
  * and generalization - more big picture to start
  * help from good handwriters on the board
  * slacking of the whiteboard is a great idea
  * get new markers
* go to break with a question in your head, and a song in your heart
* where to start? How to outline?

## lab time
* concentration can be difficult 
  * headphones - classical music, white noise, Zeppelin
  * let people know if volume becomes a problem
  * move to different spaces
  * the building is yours - move around
* working together is invaluable!
  * ...so it'll become part of assignments

## hw
* practice on granular bits of code would be good - this needs work
  * reading and comprehending small pieces of code
  * pull some of the granular bits out of the quiz and put it in hw
  * koans, ruby monk, code academy
  * ADD THIS TO ASSIGNMENTS
  * give bits of a Rails app, complete it as assignment
  * add spoiler text to Markdown (which is, apparently, possible)
* have to balance out need to keep hw doable
  * have this as separate level - granulars vs beast
* keep different modes
  * everybody deserves to be challenged
* need good environment
* wean off of the checklist more gradually - provide big ticket items, students add sub-items
* need extended, uninterrupted time to get in flow
* find time to take care of yourself
  * can be small increments
  * might not be ideal or what you're used to, but
    much better than nothing

## hw review
* on Monday for big project is good
* issues raised in standup
* gotta be a strict time limit
* provide commented solutions afterwards - I'll put up examplars this week

## syllabus/scheduling
* provide upcoming topics ahead of time
* suggested reading

## discussion during lab
* communication on slack has been great
