# Processes

## standup 
* +1 (I'd like this a bit shorter)
* maybe bring in a timer
* each person talks once, no cross-talk/comments

## quiz
* keep these
* mixture of technical details and big picture
* 15-ish minutes about the right scale
  * doesn't have to be finished, but all q's looked at

## lecture
* agenda doesn't get timeboxed that well
* timer again would be helpful
* balance between typing/listening/following along
  * slack some files instead of making people type everything

## lab time
* concentration can be difficult 
  * headphones - classical music, white noise, Zeppelin
  * let people know if volume becomes a problem
  * move to different spaces

## hw
* practice on granular bits of code would be good
  * reading and comprehending small pieces of code
* have to balance out need to keep hw doable
  * have this as separate level - granulars vs beast
* keep different modes
  * everybody deserves to be challenged
* need good environment
* need extended, uninterrupted time to get in flow
* find time to take care of yourself
  * can be small increments
  * might not be ideal or what you're used to, but
    much better than nothing

## hw review
* on Monday for big project is good
* issues raised in standup
* gotta be a strict time limit
* provide commented solutions afterwards

## discussion during lab
* communication on slack has been great
