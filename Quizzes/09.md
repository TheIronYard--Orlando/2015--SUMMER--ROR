### Routing
Suppose I had a baseball app, and in `config/routes.rb` I had the line
```ruby
get 'teams/:team_name/position/:position' => 'positions#show'
```
* Where in the app folder would I find code that would handle a request to `/teams/Phillies/position/catcher`?
* Inside that code, how would I be able to reference `Phillies` and `catcher`?
* Where would I expect to find a template associated with that request?

### Migrations

In setting up my baseball app, I'd like to have information about each team - name, city, major_league (so I can tell the majors from the minors), founding_year. 
* How can I get the database set up to hold that information?
* How could I get the Yankees (established 1903) into the db?

### Method Chain of the Day
```ruby
"This is Sparta!".split(' ').join('! ').upcase
```
* What class is the receiver of the first method call, `#split`?
* List the class of the object returned by each of those three method calls.
* Write the methods in a different order so the whole line of code still works.
* Write the methods in a different order so the line breaks.
