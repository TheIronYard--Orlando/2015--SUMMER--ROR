Create a `Boxer` class with name, weight, wins, and losses as attributes. 
The boxer should have all of those attributes readable. Give the boxer a #record method;
for a boxer with 5 wins and 2 losses, the record should be "5-2".

Rewrite the `Boxer` class as an ActiveRecord::Base subclass and assume there's a database table with name, weight, wins,
and losses. Which of the code from the non-AR::B version can be removed?

Write .winning and .undefeated methods to get all the boxers who have winning and undefeated records, respectively.

Method of the Day:
```
multiples_of_seven, non_multiples = (1..100).partition{|n| n % 7 == 0 }
