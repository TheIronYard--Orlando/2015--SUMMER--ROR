## Rails 

which routing setup causes problems, and why?
```ruby
get 'posts' => 'posts#index'
post 'posts' => 'posts#create'
```
or
```ruby
get 'posts/:id' => 'posts#show'
get 'posts/new' => 'posts#new'
```

## Git

You have cloned a GitHub repo (for which you have write privileges) into a directory at ~/projects/quiz_time, and you need to spend today working on a new feature. Your terminal is open to your home directory. Write out the series of git commands you'd need to use. Have a line that says [do work here]. Indicate any commands that would be used more than once.

## Method of the Day

Run this code and explain what it does.
```ruby
(1..10).group_by{|n| n % 3 } #=> 
```
