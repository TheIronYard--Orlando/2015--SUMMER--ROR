## Rails 

which routing setup causes problems, and why?
```ruby
get 'posts' => 'posts#index'
post 'posts' => 'posts#create'
```
or
```ruby
get 'posts/new' => 'posts#new'
get 'posts/:id' => 'posts#show'
```

## Git

You have cloned a GitHub repo (for which you have write privileges) into a directory at ~/projects/quiz_time, and you need to spend today working on a new feature. Your terminal is open to your home directory. Write out the series of git commands you'd need to use. Have a line that says [do work here]. Indicate any commands that would be used more than once.
$ cd projects/quiz_time
$ git checkout -b todays_work
   $ [do work here]
   $ git add [files you made/changed]
   $ git commit -m "[describe what you did]"
  $ git push

## Method of the Day

Run this code and explain what it does.
```ruby
(1..10).group_by{|n| n % 3 } #=> 
```
{ 1 => [ 1, 4, 7, 10 ], 2 => [ 2, 5, 8 ], 0 => [ 3, 6, 9 ] }
for each distinct return value from the code block, a key is created, and the values matching that key are the
objects in the receiver for which the code block returns that return value
