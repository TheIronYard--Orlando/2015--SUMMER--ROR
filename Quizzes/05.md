There are three style problems and two flat-out errors in this code. Fix them all.
```ruby
%(John Devan Leslie Erik Heidi Mark).each{|p|
puts '#{p} is super-cool!'
}
```

Two style problems, four Ruby errors, two HTML issues. Make it better. 
```ruby
<%= @restaurants.each do |r| %>
<ul>
        <li><a href="<%= @restaurants.website %>"><%= r => name %></li>
</ul>
end
```

Let's class this quiz up a bit. Fill in the return values for the two method calls.
```ruby
class Example
  attr_reader :name
  
  def initialize(nombre)
    @name = nombre
  end
  
  def self.name
    "I am the great and powerful #{self}"
  end
end
Example.new("Steve").name #=>
Example.name #=>
```
Now we're going to get crazy. Run the above problem in irb, then run the next problem. If you guess what happens 
before you run it, you're a superstar. If you can explain it afterward, that's still near beast mode.
```ruby
ex = Example.new("Karl")
def ex.name
  "I am unique. I am #{@name}"
end
ex.name
