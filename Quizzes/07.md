Explain what this code does. You're allowed to type it into irb to see for yourself.
```ruby
(1..100).select do |n|
  (2...n).all?{|potential_multiple| n % potential_multiple > 0}
end
```
How could you make the code more efficient? (Warning: Math is involved.)

Explain the following code. What are each of the method calls doing? What's that one argument for?
```ruby
cards = %w(Hearts Diamonds Clubs Spades).map do |suit|
  ((2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace)).map do |face_value|
    [ suit, face_value ]
  end
end
cards.flatten!(1)
```

Ditto
```ruby
unfair_grading = rand(100) > 70 ? 'Pass' : 'Fail'
```
