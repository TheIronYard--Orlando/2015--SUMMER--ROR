Explain what this code does. You're allowed to type it into irb to see for yourself.
```ruby
(1..100).select do |n|
  (2...n).all?{|potential_multiple| n % potential_multiple > 0}
end
```
How could you make the code more efficient? (Warning: Math is involved.)

Explain the following code. What are each of the method calls doing? What's that one argument for?
```ruby
cards = %w(Hearts Diamonds Clubs Spades).map do |suit|
  ((2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace)).map do |face_value|
    [ suit, face_value ]
  end
end
cards.flatten!(1)
```

Ditto
```ruby
unfair_grading = rand(100) > 70 ? 'Pass' : 'Fail'
```

Describe the flow through your application in response to a single request to "/active" or "/completed" etc.

1. A user visits the URL
2. the server identifies a route (bc there's a code block with an argument that matches the URL)
3. the code block has method calls to the Todo class, like Todo.where(finished: false), which get stored in inst var
4. the Todo class executes the .where method, which pulls info from the db
5. data comes back from db to Todo class
6. data comes back from Todo class to server
7. once the instance variables are populated, a template file which refers to the inst vars is read in and evaluated
8. the server assigns that evaluated template to response.body and returns it to the browser

PQ this is really nice for evening coding
