Let's look at some errors. For each of these, say what the error is, and explain what it means.
Assume these are the first few lines in irb.
```ruby
[1,2,3].length(5) #=> wrong number of arguments (1 for 0), meaning you tried 1 argument but the method takes 0
@this_thing.some_method #=> undefined method 'some_method' for nil
@movies = Movie.all
@movies.title #=> undefined method 'title' for <Array:#1312343ae>
@movies.each do |movie|
  movie.title
end 
other_thing.some_method 
```

Let's look at some class and instance methods. These are all from ActiveRecord::Base. Which sound like class
methods, and which instance?

* .count - finds the number of records in a db table; no argument
* #toggle - changes one boolean attribute on an object; its argument is the attribute name
* .create - saves a record to the db; its argument is a hash of attributes for the record
* #save - saves an initialized object to the db; no argument
