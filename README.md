## Hello and Welcome to Ruby on Rails at The IronYard!

What you are reading right now is called a `README` file. Software projects will commonly have a file like this in the main directory for the project to explain what the project is and how to use it. `README`s are also often found inside major subdirectories of a project. Because these files are so common, and so useful, GitHub displays them whenever you navigate to a folder inside a repository (repo) which has one.

This is the repo for the 2015 Summer Ruby on Rails course at The IronYard Orlando. Inside this repo you'll notice a couple of directories. Please take some time to read through the `README` files in each. There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/2015--SUMMER--ROR/wiki) for the class in this repo (also reachable via the book icon on the right) which has some important information on how to submit assignments and how I will grade them. 

Throughout the course, I'll be adding files to this repository to distribute assignments, notes for each class, and general information about the course. Throughout the course, you'll open, close, and contribute to Issues and Pull Requests ([more about "issues" on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues)). After you graduate, you will continue to use GitHub to store, share, and talk about code. 

There are lots of things that are going to happen after you graduate. You're going to work on interesting problems; you're going to build things that you want to have; you're going to have a new circle of friends. But between that happy future and now lies twelve hard weeks. I will make it as easy for you as I can, which means it will be really hard - but not impossible. You can do this.

Let's get started.
